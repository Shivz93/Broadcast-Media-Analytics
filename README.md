# Broadcast-Media-Analytics Case Study- GoodRx

## Business Use Case: 
### Video ads have been part of GoodRx's core marketing strategy for years. At the beginning of their video journey, they had built an internal attribution model to guide their video advertising strategy. With additional scale, they felt the need to validate their internal models with an external attribution vendor. 

## Goal: 
### They would like to compare and contrast some of the findings from the two models to determine how to best manage their video marketing going forward.

## Questions that need to be answered:
### 1. How does the overall performance compare between the internal and external models? In other words, what are the attributed user lifts for each?
### 2. How much of our spend is tracked by the external vendor?
### 3. What is the efficiency between the two models for linear or streaming? Efficiency is defined as the cost per attributed user.
### 4. Which weekday is the most efficient? The least? Does this differ by model?
### 5. Which station / daypart combination efficiency differs the most by model?
### 6. More broadly, what tests and optimizations would you suggest to determine which model is more accurate going forward?

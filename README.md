# Broadcast-Media-Analytics Case Study- GoodRx

## Business Use Case: 
### Video ads have been part of GoodRx's core marketing strategy for years. At the beginning of their video journey, they had built an internal attribution model to guide their video advertising strategy. With additional scale, they felt the need to validate their internal models with an external attribution vendor. 

## Goal: 
### They would like to compare and contrast some of the findings from the two models to determine how to best manage their video marketing going forward.
